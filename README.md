# zakBio-challenge

Discription:
To create a portfolio that will showcase my skills and talents to potential employers looking to fill a possition. This project will encompass my work done here at school as well as a few projects that I have done as a professional audio engineer. I will include the last 2 projects worked on in these modules, Run Buddy and Robot Gladiators by the time of first submission. 

- started with all that I have done with the Run Buddy page</br>
- added a redirect anchor to the header to bring you back to the home page when clicked</br>
- replaced images with one to represent myself</br>
- removed all unwanted sections and css</br>
- linked the heading attributes to jump to the coorisponding feature on the page.</br>
- linked the footer attributes to take you to my linkedin page and one to download my resume</br>
- added notes to css and html files</br>
