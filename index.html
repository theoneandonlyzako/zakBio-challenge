            <p>
              My name is Zak Stamps, and I have been immersed in the wide world of audio production for the last 30
              years spanning the worlds of live sound, broadcast audio,
              audio post-production, and music production.<br/></br>
              I currently focus primarily on mixing for live sound and in my studio where I handle music and audio
              post-production projects. When I’m not mixing, I’m often
              on the road providing audio education for churches and individuals looking to elevate their audio
              presentations to the next level.<br/></br>
              I’ve mixed and worked with a diverse group of artists over the course of my career including Praise One,
              Valley Worship, Hip hop artist Master P. Country music artist Brandon Hamilton,
              Filipino sensations IntroVoys, Christian artists MercyMe, for KING & COUNTRY, Tauren Wells, Rend
              Collective and Phil Wickham. I’ve also worked on and managed projects for corporate
              and broadcast clients including ESPN, and Stanford University. <br/></br>
              Up until Jan 2021, I spent 11 years focused on audio in Houses of Worship and served as the Technical
              Director for a large church in the San Francisco bay area, New North Church
              located in San Bruno, CA for 5 of those years. At New North, I oversaw all technical production-related
              needs for the Sunday morning experience including mixing, managing and
              training volunteers and staff.<br/></br>
              Over the course of my time on staff, I supervised two major system upgrades/installations, upgraded FOH
              and monitor consoles, redesigned the entire audio and video infrastructure,
              and optimized the production systems religiously.<br/></br>
              In addition, I was featured in a Church Production Magazine article, covering our purchase and install of
              the (at the time) freshly released ClearCom Freespeak ii system. I also
              produced and maintained the New North Weekly podcasts and New North Kids weekly YouTube channels. </br>
              At this point I’ve spent most of my life devoted to the world of audio, delving into the church world,
              high-end festival and concert life as well as high production theatre. Not
              long after getting involved in the church industry, I was introduced to the live theatre industry and fell
              in love. <br/></br>
              Ever since I have had the pleasure of working on large productions such as; Annie, Godspell, How to
              Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Footloose, the Lion King, Peter Pan,
              the Nutcracker, Cabaret, Rumors, Marry Poppins, The Producers, Music Man, Singing in the Rain, Million
              Dollar Quartet, Aida, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Saturday
              Night Fever, Smokey Joe's Cafe, and Next to Normal.<br/></br>
              Since the Pandemic, My wife and I have been blessed with the opportunity to work from home.
              Ironically, I felt a calling to go back to school to learn a new trade. so... <br/></br>
              I am currently spending my time on web development, and computer programming for all of 2021. This website
              is all about my journey through that world. I plan to fill it with things
              as I go as well as include bits and pcs of my life to showcase who I am, what I've done, and what I am
              currently doing.<br/></br>
              If you’re interested in contacting me to help with your next audio-related project, or just simply say hi,
              please fill out the form below and I’ll be happy to get in touch with you.
              <br/></br>Thanks for stopping by! ~ Zak s.
